                <em>"Windowhead have their own sound that is addictively weird. Able to make each and every track ooze with emotion 
                but have a chaotic vibe that gets under the skin."

                 <em>“Windowhead have shown a tremendous level of execution in creatively delivering their take on genres which have taken on many tired forms, 
                 but with Terrestrial they’ve shown it can feel new and exciting once again." </em> - 8/10 - Noizze

                 <em>"Beneath the distorted guitars and explosive climaxes, Terrestrials is an attempt to speak plainly. 
                  The targets are real: billionaires, media complicity, defeatism, gun fetishism, isolation. 
                  It’s not an abstract emotional exploration—it’s a statement, grounded in friction."</em> - Idioteq

                  <em>"I think what they possess is more than most do.  
                  And that is their juxtaposition of immediacy with a 
                  “big” sound and their ability to be intimate and give off the feeling of something bigger and more bold.  
                  It should be interesting what they do next."</em> - The Noise Beneath The Snow.

          <h4>Introduction</h4>
          
          <p>
            <strong>From: Brighton, UK <br>
            For Fans Of: Glassjaw, Thrice, At The Drive-In, Deftones </strong><br><br>
            Since the band's inception, Windowhead's aim has been to 
            create its own unique musical vision by incorporating different 
            textures and approaches from a wide variety of musical styles. 
            This goal was initially realised in 2018's Still Life, which 
            combined the huge crescendos of Post-Rock with the hazy 
            acoustic guitars of Lo-Fi Indie. <br><br>
            On Sunflowers (2021), the band developed 
            its sound by incorporating influences from Post-Hardcore, Shoegaze and Metal. The album is defined 
            by the juxtaposition of a dreamlike atmosphere of swirling, ethereal guitars and layered vocals with 
            the sinister edge provided by thundering drums and bass. <br><br>
            Windowhead has spent the last 3 years honing its craft as a live band, leading to an 
            increased focus on immediacy inherited from Post-Hardcore influences such as 
            Thrice, Glassjaw and At The Drive-In. The impact of this can be felt in the upcoming 
            Terrestrials EP, which combines the band's signature effects-heavy guitars with unconventional 
            time signatures, extreme dynamics and chaotic rhythms.<br>

        <div class=text><h4>Terrestrials</h4>
        <p>
            Every aspect of Terrestrials is characterised by Windowhead's development as a live band. Unpredictable shifts in 
            dynamics between ethereal soundscapes and crushing climaxes are designed to grab an audience's 
            attention by catching it off guard. Meanwhile, tracks such as Cat Insulin and Todd, Honey 
            feature hooks that will bury themselves deep into the listener's mind. <br><br>
            Windowhead's newfound focus on reaching out to their audience is also reflected in Terrestrials' lyrical content. 
            Previously, the band's work has been highly metaphorical, allowing the listener to build their own interpretation. 
            This EP takes a more direct approach, focusing on topics such as toxic masculinity, environmental collapse 
            and the role of the media in reinforcing the status quo.<br><br>
            The EP's name comes from its first track, Ex-Terrestrial. This song uses the contrast between low, heavy riffing and 
            a soaring hook to highlight the divide between ordinary people and the billionaires who hope to escape the 
            consequences of their actions on Earth by becoming "ex-terrestrials" and colonising other planets. 
            But instead of making this the title of the EP, Windowhead has chosen to name it after those who would be 
            left behind; recognising the importance that Terrestrials must 
            place upon community if they are to build a better future. <br><br> </p></div>
